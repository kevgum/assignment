# Screenshots of Build and Test Processes

This folder contains images documenting the main processes for building and testing the Hotel Booking System project. Each screenshot visually demonstrates a key step described in the main project README:

1. Clean and Compile
   - Screenshot shows the command 
   .\mvnw.cmd clean compile being run in the terminal.
    This step cleans previous build artifacts and compiles the project source code.

2. Run Tests
   - Screenshot displays the command 
   .\mvnw.cmd test
    in action. This step executes all unit tests and
     generates a test report, showing which tests pass and which fail.

3. Build Everything
- Screenshot captures the command
 .\mvnw.cmd clean compile test
being executed. This step performs a full clean,
 compiles the code and runs all tests in one go, 
 ensuring the project is ready for deployment or further development.

Refer to the images in this folder for a visual guide to each process.
